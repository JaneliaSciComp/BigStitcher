Documentation is available here [https://imagej.net/plugins/bigstitcher/].

Most of the functionality used in BigStitcher is implemented in the [multiview-reconstruction package](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/multiview-reconstruction).

A GitHub repo for massively parallelizing certain BigStitcher tasks on the cluster or cloud (**or to simply run it from the command-line**) can be found here [https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/BigStitcher-Spark].
